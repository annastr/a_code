        <p>{Currently, I am mastering my web-development skills by teaching myself how to create attractive web-pages and applications. I think we can make our world a better place by offering well-designed and user-centered websites and by making the interaction between user and product less frustrating and visually pleasant. To do so I am participating in events and project that promote education and equality.}; </p>

        <h2>A: information-specialist</h2>
        <p>{From January 2015 I am employed at the Hebrew University (the Rothberg International School) as librarian and information specialist. My responsibilities include managing library's information systems, assisting our clients in their research, preparing reference manuals and tutorials - as well as administering library's social media and producing marketing materials. I am particularly fond of making the data more accessible and simple by easing the means of exploration and analysis promoting our library's services.};</p>
